# Assumptions / Decisions

I decided that for this project I would keep with the basic setup of create react app. I didn't feel the need to eject the project to take more control over the config files.

With naming conventions I wanted to follow a BEM structure, where naming of files matched whether they were css or js files. Even though I've used CSS Modules I've still kept with naming the files after the block level class name.

I used prettier to ensure that my code was formatted consistently.
