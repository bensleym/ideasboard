# Developer Comments

Throurghly enjoyed the task of createing an ideas board. I'm generally used to using SASS and BEM for the css and Jasmin and Karma for the unit testing. For this this task I didn't want to sit within my comfort zone and so decided to use CSS Modules, Jest and Enzyme for the first time.

# Goals

All goals were completed including the stretch goals.

# Further development

If i was to carry on with developing this code I would move the inline editing components to use the uiComponents.
Create an undo component for when you delete an idea.
Create more Unit Tests.

# Live code
